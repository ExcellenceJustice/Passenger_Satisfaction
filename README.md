# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

Due to significant and huge strides in the technological advancement, things have taken new dimensions including how to assess opinions and all that. As opposed to previous crude and traditional ways of arriving at conclusions and sourcing information, this era employs more efficient ways of generating meaningful insights using modern technological tools which apparently make life easier for researchers and the society at large.

This work deals with garnering insight from a dataset collected from an airline customers about the services provided by the airline. A field assessed whether or not each passenger was satisfied. The features of the dataset were then used in training three **machine learning** algorithms to predict passenger satisfation.
